### [Estimation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2013/hh765979(v=vs.120))

Estimation is hard, one of the main reasons can be explained by Cone of Uncertainty.  
The beginning of any project is the time when we are the least certain about the project, yet it is also when we are asked to deliver estimates that are very precise.  

#### Estimation Techniques
All of these techniques require that we choose a unit of estimation—hours, days, weeks, months, ideal days, T-shirt sizing, points.  

* Counting 
* Expert judgment (individual and group)
* Decomposition
* Analogy
* Proxy estimation
* Planning poker
* Wall estimation. 

### [Scope Concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(project_management))

In project management, the term scope has two distinct uses: Project Scope and Product Scope.  
* Project Scope: "The work that needs to be accomplished to deliver a product, service, or result with the specified features and functions."
* Product Scope: "The features and functions that characterize a product, service, or result."

Scope involves getting information required to start a project, and the features the product would have that would meet its stakeholders requirements.  Notice that Project Scope is more work-oriented (the hows), while Product Scope is more oriented toward functional requirements.  

Scope Management is the listing of the items to be produced or tasks to be done to the required quantity, quality and variety, in the time and with the resources available and agreed upon, and the modification of those variable constraints.

### [Scope creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep)
Refers to changes, continuous or uncontrolled growth in a project’s scope, at any point after the project begins.  
This can occur when the scope of a project is not properly defined, documented, or controlled.  
Scope creep is a risk in most projects.  
Scope creep can be a result of:
* poor change control
* lack of proper initial identification of what is required to bring about the project objectives
* weak project manager or executive sponsor
* poor communication between parties
* lack of initial product versatility

### Story based estimations 

Story points are relative values, not fixed. There is no direct correlation between hours and points.  

Mike Cohn summarizes story points: “Story points are a unit of measure for expressing the overall size of a user story, feature or other piece of work. ” Story points tell us how big a story is, relative to others, either in terms of size or complexity. Mike often refers to “dog points” when helping teams understand the concept of relative sizing. A 2-point (small) dog would be a Chihuahua. A 13-point (big) dog would be a Great Dane. With those two guides in mind, it’s fairly easy to size the other dog breeds relative to a Chihuahua or Great Dane. A Beagle, which is about twice as big as a Chihuahua, might be a 5. A Labrador, which is bigger than a Beagle but smaller than a Great Dane, might be an 8.

When you are first learning to use story points, your team will need to establish your own fixed comparison points. To do this, choose a story from your product backlog you can all agree is small (either in terms of size or complexity) and one you all agree is huge.  

Often Fibonacci prefer over, say, T-shirt sizing or growing exponentially (4/8/16/32/64/128/256, etc.) because we humans are good at base ten. When we get out of that range, even if we are in it with, say, xs, s, m, l, xl—it becomes confusing.  

### Estimates, Targets, and Commitments 

### Overestimate vs Underestimate 

### Decomposition and Recomposition 

### Analogy-based estimations 

### [Wall estimation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2013/hh765979(v=vs.120)#wall-estimation)
![wass](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2013/images/hh765979.wall2%28vs.120%29.png)
To do Wall Estimation, you must first print your user stories on cards. Then gather your team and stakeholders in a room with a big empty wall (about 14 feet long by 8-10 feet high); Understand two things about the wall:  
* Height determines priority. Stories at the top are higher; stories at the bottom are lower. A story’s priority can be based on ROI, business value, or something as simple as “it’s just important, and I don’t know why.”  
* Width is reserved for size. Stories on the left are smaller; stories on the right are bigger. (You can reverse this and move from right to left if you’re in, say, Japan and it’s more logical.) The important thing is to envision a line going horizontally and one going vertically. Team members and stakeholders should ask themselves, where, relative to the other stories, does this one fit?  

The team will use the wall to size all of the stories. The stakeholders will use the wall to prioritize stories. As with planning poker, we’re using relative sizing, but instead of using two reference stories for comparison, the wall becomes the constant. Small story? Move to the left. Big story? Move to the right. Important story? Place it high. A story that we can live without for now? Place it low.  


## Competent

### Cone of Uncertainty 

The cone demonstrates that we have the most uncertainty at the beginning of any project (a variance of 4x to 0.25x in range).
