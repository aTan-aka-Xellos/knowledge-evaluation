### [Scope Concept](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2013/hh765979(v=vs.120))

In project management, the term scope has two distinct uses: Project Scope and Product Scope.  
* Project Scope: "The work that needs to be accomplished to deliver a product, service, or result with the specified features and functions."
* Product Scope: "The features and functions that characterize a product, service, or result."

Scope involves getting information required to start a project, and the features the product would have that would meet its stakeholders requirements.  Notice that Project Scope is more work-oriented (the hows), while Product Scope is more oriented toward functional requirements.  

Scope Management is the listing of the items to be produced or tasks to be done to the required quantity, quality and variety, in the time and with the resources available and agreed upon, and the modification of those variable constraints.

### [Scope creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep)
Refers to changes, continuous or uncontrolled growth in a projectâ€™s scope, at any point after the project begins.  
This can occur when the scope of a project is not properly defined, documented, or controlled.  
Scope creep is a risk in most projects.  
Scope creep can be a result of:
* poor change control
* lack of proper initial identification of what is required to bring about the project objectives
* weak project manager or executive sponsor
* poor communication between parties
* lack of initial product versatility
