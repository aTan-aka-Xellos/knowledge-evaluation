__Qualification Requirements Overview:__  
Base security principles and secure coding practices.

## [Basic security principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security)

![CIA](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/TRIAD.png)

The __CIA__ triad of confidentiality, integrity, and availability is at the heart of information security.  
Confidentiality, integrity and availability, also known as the CIA triad, is a model designed to guide policies for information security within an organization.

__Confidentiality__ involves a set of rules or a promise usually executed through confidentiality agreements that limits access or places restrictions on certain types of information.  
Confidentiality is roughly equivalent to privacy.  

__Integrity__ involves maintaining the consistency, accuracy, and trustworthiness of data over its entire life cycle.

__Availability__ refers to the actual availability of your data. Authentication mechanisms, access channels and systems all have to work properly for the information they protect and ensure it's available when it is needed.  

## [Secure communications fundamentals (SSL, TLS, HTTPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#SSL_2.0)

Used on application layer lvl of OSI.  
In applications design, TLS is usually implemented on top of Transport Layer protocols, encrypting all of the protocol-related data of protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, NNTP and XMPP.  

TSL and SSL are cryptographic protocols designed to provide communications security over a computer network. 
The TLS protocol aims primarily to provide privacy and data integrity.  

### SSL

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) stands for Secure Sockets Layer and, in short, it's the standard technology for keeping an internet connection secure and safeguarding any sensitive data that is being sent between two systems, preventing criminals from reading and modifying any information transferred, including potential personal details.  

TLS (Transport Layer Security) is just an updated, more secure, version of SSL.  
Latest version: TLS 1.3  

HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure) appears in the URL when a website is secured by an SSL certificate.  

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.  
In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS), or, formerly, its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The protocol is therefore also often referred to as HTTP over TLS, or HTTP over SSL.
