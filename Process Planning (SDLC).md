## [SDLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle)  
The systems development life cycle, is a term used in systems engineering, information systems and software engineering to describe a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system.  
There are usually six stages in this cycle: analysis, design, development and testing, implementation, documentation, and evaluation.

## [Software development process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process)
 Software development process is the process of dividing software development work into distinct phases to improve design, product management, and project management. 
 It is also known as a software development life cycle.
 
### Software development activities:
* Processes 
* Requirements 
* Design 
* Engineering 
* Construction 
* Testing 
* Debugging 
* Deployment 
* Maintenance


## Basics of SDLC models:
## [Waterfall Concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model)
The waterfall model is a relatively linear sequential design approach for certain areas of engineering design. In software development, it tends to be among the less iterative and flexible approaches, as progress flows in largely one direction ("downwards" like a waterfall) through the phases of conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, deployment and maintenance.  

### Model:
1. System and software requirements: captured in a product requirements document
2. Analysis: resulting in models, schema, and business rules
3. Design: resulting in the software architecture
4. Coding: the development, proving, and integration of software
5. Testing: the systematic discovery and debugging of defects
6. Operations: the installation, migration, support, and maintenance of complete systems  
Thus the waterfall model maintains that one should move to a phase only when its preceding phase is reviewed and verified.  

#### Supporting arguments
A further argument for the waterfall model is that it places emphasis on documentation (such as requirements documents and design documents).  

The waterfall model provides a structured approach; the model itself progresses linearly through discrete, easily understandable and explainable phases and thus is easy to understand; it also provides easily identifiable milestones in the development process.  

#### Criticism
Clients may not know exactly what their requirements are before they see working software and so change their requirements, leading to redesign, redevelopment, and retesting, and increased costs.  

Designers may not be aware of future difficulties when designing a new software product or feature.  

## [Agile software development concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)
Agile software development is an approach to software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s).  
It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change.  

The term agile was popularized, in this context, by the ]Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#The_Agile_Manifesto).  

### Agile Manifesto values  
* Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools
* Working Software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to Change over following a plan  

### Agile software development principles
The Manifesto for Agile Software Development is based on twelve principles:

* Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
* Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.
* Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)
* Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
* Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
* Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
* Working software is the primary measure of progress
* Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
* Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
* Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
* Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly  

### Agile vs. waterfall
One of the differences between agile software development methods and waterfall is the approach to quality and testing. In the waterfall model, there is always a separate testing phase after a build phase; however, in agile software development testing is completed in the same iteration as programming.  

Another difference is that traditional "waterfall" software development moves a project through various Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) phases. One phase is completed in its entirety before moving on to the next phase.  

This iterative approach supports a product rather than a project mindset.  

### Agile software development practices

* Acceptance test-driven development (ATDD)
* Agile modeling
* Agile testing
* Backlogs (Product and Sprint)
* Behavior-driven development (BDD)
* Continuous integration (CI)
* Cross-functional team
* Domain-driven design (DDD)
* Pair programming
* Planning poker
* Refactoring
* Scrum events (sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint review and retrospective)
* Story-driven modeling
* Test-driven development (TDD)


## [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development))

Scrum is a lightweight, iterative and incremental framework for managing product development.  
It defines "a flexible, holistic product development strategy where a development team works as a unit to reach a common goal", and enables teams to self-organize by encouraging physical co-location or close online collaboration of all team members, as well as daily face-to-face communication among all team members and disciplines involved.   
It is designed for teams of three to nine members, who break their work into actions that can be completed within timeboxed iterations, called sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks, then track progress and re-plan in 15-minute time-boxed stand-up meetings, called daily scrums.  

A key principle of Scrum is the dual recognition that customers will change their minds about what they want or need (often called requirements volatility) and that there will be unpredictable challenges - for which a predictive or planned approach is not suited.  

### Roles and responsibilities

#### Product owner  

The product owner, representing the product's stakeholders and the voice of the customer, is responsible for the product backlog and accountable for maximizing the value that the team delivers. 

The product owner defines the product in customer-centric terms (typically user stories), adds them to the product backlog, and prioritizes them based on importance and dependencies.  

This role should not be combined with that of the scrum master.  
The product owner should not dictate how the team reaches a technical solution, but rather will seek consensus among the team members.  
This role is crucial and requires a deep understanding of both sides: the business and the engineers (developers) in the scrum team.  
Communication is a core responsibility of the product owner.  

##### Responsibilities:
* Organize further meetings to demonstrate the solution to key stakeholders who were not present at a sprint review.
* Define and announce releases.
* Communicate delivery and team status.
* Share progress during governance meetings.
* Share RAID (Risks, Assumptions, Issues and Dependencies) with stakeholders.
* Negotiate priorities, scope, funding, and schedule.
* Ensure that the product backlog is visible, transparent and clear.

#### Development team
The development team is responsible for delivering potentially releasable product increments every sprint.  

The development team in Scrum is self-organizing, and any interaction outside the team is managed by the scrum master (who will protect the team), or the product owner (who has regular interactions with all stakeholders).  

The team has from three to nine members who carry out all tasks required to build the product increments (analysis, design, development, testing, technical writing, etc.).

#### Scrum master
Scrum is facilitated by a scrum master, who is accountable for removing impediments to the ability of the team to deliver the product goals and deliverables.  

The scrum master is not a traditional team lead or project manager but acts as a buffer between the team and any distracting influences.   
The scrum master ensures that the scrum framework is followed.  

One of the ways the scrum master role differs from a project manager is that the latter may have people management responsibilities and the scrum master does not.  

##### Responsibilities:
* Helping the product owner maintain the product backlog
* Helping the team to determine the definition of done for the product
* Coaching the team, within the Scrum principles
* Promoting self-organization within the team
* Helping the scrum team to avoid or remove impediments to its progress, whether internal or external to the team
* Facilitating team events to ensure regular progress
* Educating key stakeholders on Agile and Scrum principles

### Artifacts (Scrum board, Cards, Epics, Stories, Tasks, Backlogs, Sprint, Increment, etc.)


### Estimation (Story Points, Velocity, Sprint Burndown Chart, Feature Burnup Chart)
	
	
### Ceremonies (Release planning, Sprint planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint demo, Sprint retrospective)

#### Sprint
A sprint (or iteration) is the basic unit of development in Scrum.  
The duration is fixed in advance for each sprint and is normally between one week and one month, with two weeks being the most common.  
Each sprint starts with a sprint planning event and ends with a sprint review and sprint retrospective.  
Scrum emphasizes working product at the end of the sprint that is really done.  

#### Sprint planning
At the beginning of a sprint, the scrum team holds a sprint planning event to:
* Mutually discuss and agree on the scope of work that is intended to be done during that sprint
* Select product backlog items that can be completed in one sprint
* Prepare a sprint backlog
* The recommended duration is four hours for a two-week sprint

#### Daily scrum
Each day during a sprint, the team holds a daily scrum with specific guidelines:
* All members of the development team come prepared
* Starts precisely on time even if some development team members are missing
* Should happen at the same time and place every day
* Is limited (timeboxed) to fifteen minutes
* Anyone is welcome, though only development team members should contribute
* During the daily scrum, each team member typically answers three questions:
  * What did I complete yesterday?
  * What do I plan to complete today?
  * Do I see any impediment that could prevent me or the team from meeting our sprint goal?
* No detailed discussions should happen during the daily scrum

#### Sprint review
At the sprint review, the team:
* Reviews the work that was completed and the planned work that was not completed
* Presents the completed work to the stakeholders (a.k.a. the demo)
* Collaborates with the stakeholders on what to work on next

Guidelines for sprint reviews:
* Incomplete work cannot be demonstrated
* The recommended duration is two hours for a two-week sprint

#### Sprint retrospective
At the sprint retrospective, the team:
* Reflects on the past sprint
* Identifies and agrees on continuous process improvement actions

Guidelines for sprint retrospectives:
* Three main questions are asked in the sprint retrospective: 
  * What went well during the sprint? 
  * What did not go well? 
  * What could be improved for better productivity in the next sprint?
* The recommended duration is one-and-a-half hours for a two-week sprint

#### Backlog refinement (grooming)
Grooming is the ongoing process of reviewing product backlog items and checking that they are appropriately prepared and ordered in a way that makes them clear and executable for teams once they enter sprints via the sprint planning activity.
