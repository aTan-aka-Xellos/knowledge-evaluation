### [SDLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle)  
The systems development life cycle, is a term used in systems engineering, information systems and software engineering to describe a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system.  
There are usually six stages in this cycle: analysis, design, development and testing, implementation, documentation, and evaluation.

### [Software development process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process)
 Software development process is the process of dividing software development work into distinct phases to improve design, product management, and project management. 
 It is also known as a software development life cycle.
 
#### Software development activities:
* Processes 
* Requirements 
* Design 
* Engineering 
* Construction 
* Testing 
* Debugging 
* Deployment 
* Maintenance


### Basics of SDLC models:
### [Waterfall Concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model)
The waterfall model is a relatively linear sequential design approach for certain areas of engineering design. In software development, it tends to be among the less iterative and flexible approaches, as progress flows in largely one direction ("downwards" like a waterfall) through the phases of conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, deployment and maintenance.  

#### Model:
1. System and software requirements: captured in a product requirements document
2. Analysis: resulting in models, schema, and business rules
3. Design: resulting in the software architecture
4. Coding: the development, proving, and integration of software
5. Testing: the systematic discovery and debugging of defects
6. Operations: the installation, migration, support, and maintenance of complete systems  
Thus the waterfall model maintains that one should move to a phase only when its preceding phase is reviewed and verified.  

##### Supporting arguments
A further argument for the waterfall model is that it places emphasis on documentation (such as requirements documents and design documents).  

The waterfall model provides a structured approach; the model itself progresses linearly through discrete, easily understandable and explainable phases and thus is easy to understand; it also provides easily identifiable milestones in the development process.  

##### Criticism
Clients may not know exactly what their requirements are before they see working software and so change their requirements, leading to redesign, redevelopment, and retesting, and increased costs.  

Designers may not be aware of future difficulties when designing a new software product or feature.  

### [Agile software development concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)


Scrum

* Roles and responsibilities

* Artifacts (Scrum board, Cards, Epics, Stories, Tasks, Backlogs, Sprint, Increment, etc.)
	
* Estimation (Story Points, Velocity, Sprint Burndown Chart, Feature Burnup Chart)
	
* Ceremonies (Release planning, Sprint planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint demo, Sprint retrospective)
