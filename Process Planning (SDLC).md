### [SDLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle)  
The systems development life cycle, is a term used in systems engineering, information systems and software engineering to describe a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system.  
There are usually six stages in this cycle: analysis, design, development and testing, implementation, documentation, and evaluation.

### [Software development process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process)
 Software development process is the process of dividing software development work into distinct phases to improve design, product management, and project management. 
 It is also known as a software development life cycle.
 
#### Software development activities:
* Processes 
* Requirements 
* Design 
* Engineering 
* Construction 
* Testing 
* Debugging 
* Deployment 
* Maintenance


### Basics of SDLC models:
### [Waterfall Concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model)
The waterfall model is a relatively linear sequential design approach for certain areas of engineering design. In software development, it tends to be among the less iterative and flexible approaches, as progress flows in largely one direction ("downwards" like a waterfall) through the phases of conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, deployment and maintenance.  

#### Model:
1. System and software requirements: captured in a product requirements document
2. Analysis: resulting in models, schema, and business rules
3. Design: resulting in the software architecture
4. Coding: the development, proving, and integration of software
5. Testing: the systematic discovery and debugging of defects
6. Operations: the installation, migration, support, and maintenance of complete systems  
Thus the waterfall model maintains that one should move to a phase only when its preceding phase is reviewed and verified.  

##### Supporting arguments
A further argument for the waterfall model is that it places emphasis on documentation (such as requirements documents and design documents).  

The waterfall model provides a structured approach; the model itself progresses linearly through discrete, easily understandable and explainable phases and thus is easy to understand; it also provides easily identifiable milestones in the development process.  

##### Criticism
Clients may not know exactly what their requirements are before they see working software and so change their requirements, leading to redesign, redevelopment, and retesting, and increased costs.  

Designers may not be aware of future difficulties when designing a new software product or feature.  

### [Agile software development concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)
Agile software development is an approach to software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s).  
It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change.  

The term agile was popularized, in this context, by the ]Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#The_Agile_Manifesto).  

#### Agile Manifesto values  
* Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools
* Working Software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to Change over following a plan  

#### Agile software development principles
The Manifesto for Agile Software Development is based on twelve principles:

* Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
* Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.
* Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)
* Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
* Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
* Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
* Working software is the primary measure of progress
* Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
* Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
* Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
* Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly  

#### Agile vs. waterfall
One of the differences between agile software development methods and waterfall is the approach to quality and testing. In the waterfall model, there is always a separate testing phase after a build phase; however, in agile software development testing is completed in the same iteration as programming.  

Another difference is that traditional "waterfall" software development moves a project through various Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) phases. One phase is completed in its entirety before moving on to the next phase.  

This iterative approach supports a product rather than a project mindset.  

#### Agile software development practices

* Acceptance test-driven development (ATDD)
* Agile modeling
* Agile testing
* Backlogs (Product and Sprint)
* Behavior-driven development (BDD)
* Continuous integration (CI)
* Cross-functional team
* Domain-driven design (DDD)
* Pair programming
* Planning poker
* Refactoring
* Scrum events (sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint review and retrospective)
* Story-driven modeling
* Test-driven development (TDD)


### Scrum

* Roles and responsibilities

* Artifacts (Scrum board, Cards, Epics, Stories, Tasks, Backlogs, Sprint, Increment, etc.)
	
* Estimation (Story Points, Velocity, Sprint Burndown Chart, Feature Burnup Chart)
	
* Ceremonies (Release planning, Sprint planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint demo, Sprint retrospective)
